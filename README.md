# Star-Wars Carousel 

<p>This project was made as part of a interview coding challenge.</p>

<p>One change I made to the brief was rather than having, domain/2 going to a particular page, I changed it to domain/characters/2. This can be easily changed to the former way but I thought this was more scalable.</p>
